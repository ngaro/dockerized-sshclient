# Docker Base Images with OpenSSH Client

These are base images from different distros with an OpenSSH __CLIENT__ added.

## Use Case
These images are designed for one specific use case: accessing systems with SSH servers that frequently change their host keys (e.g., a system with a fixed IP that you often reinstall for testing). 

Using the SSH client on my host system would require modifying my `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, which I prefer to avoid. Instead, these images create a temporary `known_hosts` file each time.

## Usage
Some examples:
```bash
# A simple connection to "server" as "user":
docker run -it --rm garo/openssh-client ssh user@server
# But this time you want to be able to login with your keys instead of password:
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa:ro garo/openssh-client ssh user@server
# And now you also want some compression on the connection
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa:ro garo/openssh-client ssh -C user@server
# And now you suddenly hate Alpine and want to use the Ubuntu-based image
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa:ro garo/openssh-client:ubuntu ssh -C user@server
# And now you want to go lightweight and want a image only containing ssh. Note the slash in front of ssh here !
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa:ro garo/openssh-client:empty /ssh -C user@server
```

## Available Images
The images are named `garo/openssh-client:tag-of-the-distro` and are available for the amd64 and arm64 architectures.

| Distro       | Distro Version | OpenSSH Version | Tag(s)
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Alpine       |         3.20.2 |           9.7p1 |`alpine`, `latest` |
| Kali         |         2024.2 |           9.7p1 |`kali`             |
| Ubuntu       |         24.04  |           9.6p1 |`ubuntu`           |
| OpenSSH-only |        __/__   |         9.6p1   | `empty`, `dev`    |

Extra info:
- The Alpine also has the tag `latest`. This means that if you use `garo/openssh-client` without tag you'll get Alpine
- The `empty` image is a extremely minimal image with the client at `/ssh` and a 1-line `/etc/passwd` that defines the root user.
<br> __No__ other files or directories are be present. This implies thay you will have to launch it as `/ssh` instead of `ssh`


## Contributing
- Bugfixes and Dockerfile's for new distributions are always welcome. Submit all pull requests to the `dev` branch.
- If you create a Dockerfile ensure that the file name is `Dockerfile.distroname` and that they are the base images of that distro + the OpenSSH client. Try to avoid extra packages as much as you can.
- Don't submit bugfixes for the `empty` image just yet. I want to work on that one on my own for now.<br>_Once I'll start accepting PR's for `empty` i will remove this message_
